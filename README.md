# "Insightful Excel: A Data Analysis and Visualization Project using Power Query and Pivot Tables"
As a data analyst, my recent Excel project involved merging two files using Power Query. 
To ensure accurate merging, I used similar columns from both sheets and checked the data types. 
After merging the files, I proceeded to clean the data and loaded it into Excel.
To further analyze the data, I added an integer column using Power Query to calculate the attrition rate. 
Once the data was properly prepared, I utilized Pivot Tables to extract insights from the data. 
Pivot Tables allowed me to quickly and easily summarize and analyze large amounts of data.
I created a dashboard using Excel's built-in tools. 
The dashboard included charts and tables that were updated dynamically as the underlying data changed. 
I also included a slicer in the dashboard to allow users to filter the data based on different criteria.
Overall, my Excel project involved merging, cleaning, and analyzing data using Power Query and Pivot Tables, 
and creating a dynamic dashboard to visualize and communicate the findings.
